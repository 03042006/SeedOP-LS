**Managing Wallets**

- View Wallets: All added wallets will be displayed in the list below the form.

- Show Details: Click the Show button to reveal the seed phrase or private key for the selected wallet.

- Edit Wallet: Click the Edit button to update the walletâ€™s seed phrase or private key.

- Delete Wallet: Click the Delete button to remove the wallet from Local Storage.

**Local Storage**

- The wallets are stored locally in the browser's Local Storage, which means they will persist even after refreshing the page. However, they will not be accessible across devices or browsers.

**Notifications**

- Using react-toastify, the app provides feedback for actions such as saving, editing, and deleting wallets. Notifications are displayed at the top-right of the screen and automatically disappear after 3 seconds.

# Customization

**Toastify Customization**

You can customize the Toast notifications in the App.js file. The current ToastContainer is configured as:
```bash
    <ToastContainer
    position="top-right"
    autoClose={3000}
    hideProgressBar={false}
    newestOnTop={false}
    closeOnClick
    rtl={false}
    pauseOnFocusLoss
    draggable
    pauseOnHover
    theme="dark"
    />
```

To modify the colors or styles, visit the official react-toastify documentation.

**TailwindCSS Customization**

- The app is styled with TailwindCSS. You can modify the styling in the component files or tailwind.config.js to change colors, spacing, typography, etc.

# Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend library for building UI.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **uuid**: For generating unique IDs for the wallets.
- **react-toastify**: For toast notifications.
- **Local Storage**: Browser API for persisting data.

# Future Enhancements
- Integration with a backend service (e.g., MongoDB) to store wallet data securely.
- User authentication for better data security.
- Option to encrypt private keys/seed phrases before saving them in Local Storage.
- Support for multiple languages.
